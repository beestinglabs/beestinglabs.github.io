---

Preamble:  
As a language, Scorch is not designed to be speedy to use, rather easy to pick up and understand if you are arriving from a creative/musical background rather than a programming background. The aim is that Scorch makes algorithmic composition a more accessible form of audio composition. Check out the [manifesto](https://archive.wetink.org/archive-06/the-scorch-manifesto/).

Below, find current documentation and examples of the Scorch language. For tutorials and more in depth walkthroughs to get started in different DAWs and get composing, check out [this](www.google.com).
